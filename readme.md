## Pond free detection

### Nicholas Wright

This code will read in a classified (with OSSP) IceBridge image and detect pond free regions in the ice. One can optionally provide the raw OIB image that corresponds to the classified one in order to output a visual demonstration of what the pond free detection algorithm is doing.

Filepaths in the script must be changed to match your specific file system.
